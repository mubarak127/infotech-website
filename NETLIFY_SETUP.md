4. Wait for deployment (usually 30 seconds)
5. Your site is live! ðŸŽ‰

### Method B: Connect to GitHub

2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub account

## Step 5: Form Handling (Bonus!)
Netlify can handle your contact form without Google Apps Script:

3. Netlify will automatically collect form submissions

## Alternative: Netlify Forms
If you want to use Netlify's built-in form handling instead of Google Apps Script:

```html
<!-- In your form -->
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true" action="/">
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />
  <!-- Your existing form fields -->
</form>
```

This will send form submissions to your Netlify dashboard automatically!
